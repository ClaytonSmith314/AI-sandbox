tensor <==> set
it's basicly the same idea. You have a bunch of values that can be queried in some way.

models list:
 - Linear Model:
 - Deep Neural Networks:
 - Clustering:
 - hidden Markov Models: probability distributions - finite set of states, each of which is associated with a
    probability distribution. Transitions among the states are governed by a set of probabilities called
    transition probabilities. At state x, their is a certain probabilities that y is true
